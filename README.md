# Film-Performance-Insights-A-Relational-Database-for-20-2024-2025-Releases
## Project Summary:
This project builds a relational database to organize and analyze data from 20
films released between 2024 and 2025. It stores essential information such as
titles, genres, casts, directors, and ratings to support data-driven insights into
practical applications such as casting, script development, and budgeting.
By capturing variables such as genre, actor performance, and release timing, the
system supports advanced analytics, including machine learning and NLP.
Analysts can use the data to forecast revenue, assess audience impact, and
identify key drivers of a film’s success.
Overall, the project performed a well-designed relational model that link
operational film data with analytical forecasting, enabling more informed,
evidence-based business decisions.
Note: Ratings are sourced from Rotten Tomatoes due to time constraints.
## 1. Production Strategy: Casting
### Questions: Which actors consistently appear in movies with the highest ratings?
Studios can utilize databases like this to see which actors would generate the most
value by identifying who consistently plays high-rated products, supporting
higher salary justifications during contract negotiations. Additionally, Producers
can also use these insights to justify lead actors’ salaries to investors.
## 2. Competitive Benchmarking (KPIs)
### Questions: Which genre is the most 'saturated' (has the most entries) in 2024 -
2025?
With 20 movies from 2024-2025, we can perform trend analysis to determine
which genres are most popular and identify the gaps in the market. For example,
if certain genres dominate in 2024–2025, a studio might focus on other genres to
capture an underserved audience.
